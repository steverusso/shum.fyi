# Shum.fyi

Should Have Used Monero!

## Getting Started

### Development

With [`Hugo 0.83.1`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.83.1)
installed, simply run `hugo server -D` from the `./website` directory. This
will build and serve the website (with live reloading) from
`http://localhost:1313`.

### Production

With both [`Hugo
0.83.1`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.83.1) and at least
[`Go 1.16`](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16) installed, simply run `make` from
the root of the repository to build the full production binary (available at
`./server/shumfyid`) which will contain the static web resources embedded
within it. To run production locally on `http://localhost:8080`, either run the
binary with `./server/shumfyid -p 8080` or run `make run` from the root of the
repository.

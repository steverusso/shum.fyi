Reports started cirulating that BlockFi users were having their accounts
flagged if their deposits had recent coinjoin history:

> Have received multiple reports that @TheRealBlockFi is flagging deposits with
> coinjoin history. Majority of flags have been for utxos that interacted with
> Wasabi's fixed fee address which has since been removed. 
>
> Either way expect this to continue. Not your keys, not your coins.

The CEO of BlockFi later tweeted in a difcerent thread that coinjoining is part
of the company's ["prohibited activities"](https://archive.ph/HhT2e), and they
[partner with companies like Chainalysis](https://archive.ph/IiNzP) to police
these prohibited activities:

> It's prohibited activity and we reserve the right to freeze / return deposits
> from mixing services..is there something specific you want us to be more
> transparent about? We don't have a choice based on how we are regulated.

Other users pointed out that coinjoining is not considered illegal nor is even
suspicious by itself, but that it does [harm the business model of companies
like Chainalysis](https://archive.ph/IiNzP#selection-5417.0-5417.254):

> You're following regulations that don't exist. Coinjoin is not illegal, nor
> is it suspicious without more evidence of the same. 
>
> Chainalysis has convinced  you to pay them to solve problems they created for
> you and pushed on our industry. 
>
> Please reconsider your position.

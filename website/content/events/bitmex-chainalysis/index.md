BitMEX enhanced their partnership with surveillance corporation Chainalysis to
"identify, investigate, and stop illicit transactions." BitMEX was already
using a Chainalysis product (as a Chainalysis representative [told
_Cointelegraph_](https://archive.ph/F7XH9#selection-909.145-909.390)), but now
they had integrated with the "real-time transaction monitoring compliance"
product from Chainalysis. The blog post from BitMEX [opened with the
following](https://archive.ph/Ng2BZ#selection-975.0-975.454):

> As part of our long-term partnership with Chainalysis, we are deepening our
> integration with this leading blockchain intelligence provider to bolster our
> ability to identify, investigate, and stop illicit transactions. By layering
> Chainalysisâ€™ highly regarded KYT (Know Your Transaction) screening
> capabilities over our existing processes, we are broadening our compliance
> capabilities to continue to ensure the BitMEX platform is as secure as
> possible.

This happened about three months after Chainalysis had [rated BitMEX as "high
risk"](https://archive.ph/Q0RfT) because the U.S. Department of Justice charged
several BitMEX executives with "facilitating money laundering."

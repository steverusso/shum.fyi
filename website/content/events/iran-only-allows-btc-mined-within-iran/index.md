The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) started allowing other financial institutions
(besides just itself) to use cryptocurrency internationally, but only
cryptocurrency that was mined by a licensed crypto miner within Iran.
[_CoinTelegraph_ reported](https://archive.ph/nknQi#selection-889.0-909.2):

> According to a report from the English-language Iranian economic news source
> Financial Tribune, the Central Bank of Iran, or CBI, is authorizing banks and
> licensed forex shops to use cryptocurrency as payments for imports.
>
> Under its regulatory framework, the cryptocurrency must derive from licensed
> crypto miners only. These mining operations are officially permitted by the
> Iranian state as an industrial activity and require operators to secure a
> license from the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade.

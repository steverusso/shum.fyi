Reddit user `u/Bujuu`
[posted](https://archive.ph/UOGev#selection-2029.0-2029.76) that their BitVavo
account was shutdown shortly after making a withdrawal to a Wasabi coinjoin:

> I did indeed sent my BTC to my Wasabi wallet and used the coinjoin in there.

The message they received from BitVavo contained [the
following](https://archive.ph/UOGev#selection-2039.0-2039.616):

> [...] Your account has been closed. [...]
> Bitvavo is required by European law to have sufficient knowledge of its
> users, their accounts and the transactions associated with those accounts.
> Bitvavo must estimate the risks that a user can pose for Bitvavo. If the
> risks turn out to be too great, Bitvavo is obliged to take measures to
> mitigate these risks. From a risk perspective, <mark>Bitvavo has decided that it is
> not possible to continue to offer you a Bitvavo account because the amount
> and frequency of your transaction (s) to or from mixing services poses an
> unacceptable risk.</mark> [...]

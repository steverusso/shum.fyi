Even as [the U.S. capitol riot](/e/financial-crackdowns-us-capitol-riot/)
narrative [was in the process](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-false-and-exaggerated-claims)
of [completely falling apart](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/as-the-insurrection-narrative-crumbles),
the [government was still using it](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-squad-enables-pelosis-massive)
to [push an authoritarian agenda](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-new-domestic-war-on-terror-has).
Simultaneously, the corporate media and financial corporations were weilding
their power to engage in financial censorship.

As the defendants from January 6th were slowly moving through the legal system,
they were attempting to crowdfund their defense fees online. Seeing this, a
group _USA Today_ "journalists" not only successfully attempted to have certain
fundraisers shutdown, but they then wrote a report bragging about it!  As
actual journalist Glenn Greenwald said in [his article on the
matter](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/journalists-attack-the-powerless),
"they went so far as to tattle to PayPal and other funding sites on two of
those defendants." The following [are
excerpts](https://archive.ph/jswyS#selection-1155.0-1171.77) from the _USA
Today_ article describing exactly that:

> Wednesday, a USA TODAY reporter was able to donate $10 to Biggs' fundraiser
> on Our Freedom Funding, using Stripe to process the payment.
>
> A few hours later, his campaign disappeared from Our Freedom Funding.

> A USA TODAY reporter was able to make a $1 donation to Pezzola's fundraiser
> using Venmo, a payment app owned by PayPal. After being alerted by USA TODAY,
> Venmo removed the account. 
>
> Soon a PayPal account took its place. PayPal caught that and removed it, too.

The _Electronic Frontier Foundation_ wrote an article in response titled
_Crowdfunding Legal Fees Is Not a Crime_ in which [they
highlighted](https://archive.ph/b1apQ#selection-1051.0-1051.473) "the behavior
that people are demanding that these companies regulate is not, in most cases,
illegal." Glenn Greenwald (in his piece) also pointed out largely non-violent
nature of the charges:

> Whatever you think about the Capitol riot, <mark>everyone has the right to a
> legal defense</mark> and to do what they can to ensure they have the best
> legal defense possible â€” <mark>especially when the full weight of the Justice
> Department is crashing down on your head even for non-violent
> offenses</mark>, which is what many of these defendants are charged with due
> to the politically charged nature of the investigation.

The _USA Today_ article actually concluded with detailing how they got Cash App
to ban a "neo-nazi" after they reached out to Cash App for comment. Let's give
_USA Today_ every benefit of the doubt: let's say simply being a "neo-nazi" is
against their ToS, and that the person they targeted is actually a "neo-nazi."
That means, in the best case, that a giant media corporation is acting as the
selective policing arm of a giant financial corporation:

> This month, Miller, known to his thousands of fans as Gypsy Crusader, used
> the messaging app Telegram to ask for donations through Cash App, which is
> owned by Square.
>
> [...]
>
> After being alerted by USA TODAY, Cash App removed the account benefiting
> Miller, but a new one soon popped up in its place. 
>
> By Monday morning, that account had also been removed.

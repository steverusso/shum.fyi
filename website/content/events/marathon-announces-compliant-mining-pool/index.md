Marathon, a Bitcoin mining corporation based in the U.S., announced that it
would be creating a mining pool which would be totally compliant with U.S.
financial regulations. The press release [opened with the
following](https://archive.ph/CBDoo#selection-947.0-961.330):

> Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. [...], today announced that the Company will
> be launching the first Bitcoin mining pool based in North America that is
> fully compliant with U.S. regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML)
> and the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s (OFAC’s) standards.

The press release [went on to
mention](https://archive.ph/CBDoo#selection-969.0-969.298) that Marathon had
"exclusively licensed" software from DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. in order to
properly filter transactions (this was also announced in [a separate press
release](https://archive.ph/tO8qR) issued by DMG Blockchain Solutions):

> To set up its pool, Marathon has exclusively licensed technology from DMG
> Blockchain that allows the Company to filter transactions. Marathon intends
> to leverage this technology to ensure that its mining pool adheres to AML
> regulations and that all transactions are compliant with OFAC’s standards.

The pool [mined its first "compliant"
block](/e/marathon-mines-first-compliant-block/) about a month later on May 6.

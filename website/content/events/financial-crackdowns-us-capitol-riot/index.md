Shortly after [the U.S. capitol
riot](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-new-domestic-war-on-terror-is) on
January 6, 2021, and about [a month before the
narrative](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-false-and-exaggerated-claims)
started [to completely
collapse](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/as-the-insurrection-narrative-crumbles),
payment platforms and surveillance firms worked to expose and disrupt the
funding mechanisms of people present at the capitol that day.

GoFundMe actually kicked things off during the months prior [by
removing](https://archive.ph/UnAvg#selection-1305.17-1305.119) "fundraiser
attempts that appeared to challenge the legitimacy of 2020 election results."
Several days after the riot, they removed "numerous fundraisers intended to
raise money for travel expenses." GoFundMe said the following in [a statement
to Fox News](https://archive.ph/UnAvg#selection-1277.0-1285.194):

> "Due to the violence, GoFundMe has removed numerous fundraisers intended to
> raise money for travel expenses. GoFundMe will remove fundraisers for travel
> expenses to a future political event where there's risk of violence by the
> attendees," a spokesperson for GoFundMe told Fox News in a statement.
>
> "We continue to enforce our terms of service and do not tolerate fundraisers
> supporting hate, violence, harassment, or spreading misinformation about the
> 2020 election," the statement continued.

Just use Bitcoin, right? A few days later, Chainalysis published a report on [a
Bitcoin transaction](https://archive.ph/Cxl5f#selection-325.0-325.232) of 28.15
Bitcoins made on December 8, 2020 to several different "far-right activists and
internet personalities." Not only was Chainalysis able to [scrutinize the
entire Bitcoin financial history of people such as Nick
Fuentes](https://archive.ph/Cxl5f#selection-381.0-381.219) (someone who did not
even participate in the "riot"), but they were even [able to identify the
donor](https://archive.ph/Cxl5f#selection-317.0-317.570). The article
[concludes](https://archive.ph/Cxl5f#selection-451.317-451.735) by pointing out
how Chainalysis can help law enforcement "prevent funds from reaching violent
groups."

> Luckily, thanks to the inherent transparency of cryptocurrency blockchains,
> law enforcement can track these transactions in real time and work with
> cryptocurrency businesses to prevent funds from reaching violent groups who
> may use them to fund their operations and commit acts of violence.
> Chainalysis is actively looking to identify any additional extremist payments
> and activity and will keep our customers updated.

Setting aside violence perpetrated by the government, the ability to block
funds from a violent group means the ability to block funds from any group,
including a non-violent one.

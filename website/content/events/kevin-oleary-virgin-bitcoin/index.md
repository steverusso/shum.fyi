Shark tank investor Kevin O'Leary appeared on _CoinDesk TV_ to talk about
regulatory environments changing, crypto market volatility, and (primarily)
provenance requirements for institutional investors. He predicts that over the
next year, he'll be partnered with "five to ten different miners" which will
allow him to acquire "virgin coin" that he can sell at a premium. The following
is a transcript [of an excerpt from the
interview](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=QArNYefZHmE&t=615) where O'Leary elaborates
on this issue:

> I don't think the community, if you want to call it that, realizes how big a
> deal this is going to become. And the value is going to be, <mark>and there
> will be a premium, on coin that you can say was mined ethically, was mined on
> a sustainable mandate or protocol, was mined and you know the provenance of
> it versus all other coins. Consider it the same debate going on with blood
> diamonds if you would. "Blood coin," you know? The same idea.</mark> Is this
> coming from a place where I can feel that no institution or employee would
> think it was gained wrongfully. That's the issue, believe me. Watch this
> happen. Watch this become the number one issue over the next 18 months.

Bottlepay flagged and returned an incoming transaction from Twitter user
@Marty_P_B because the Bitcoin had a recent coinjoin history, specifically via
Samourai's mixing service Whirlpool:

> @bottlepay have rejected my incoming btc transactions due to the coins
> having been in samourai wallet and/or mixed with @SamouraiWallet
> #Whirlpool
>
> If you have been sent mixed coins you will get stung. @matt_odell
> @PeterMcCormack @proofofsteph #bitcoin

> In their defence, they did return the btc as quickly as they could, but this
> will impact a lot of customers. Who has the ability to check history of all
> of their utxos and whether or not they have been in a @SamouraiWallet or have
> been mixed? Virtually no one

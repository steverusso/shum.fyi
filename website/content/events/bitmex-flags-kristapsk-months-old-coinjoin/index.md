BitMEX flagged @kristapsk's account and demanded KYC/AML data due to a coinjoin
deposit made over six months prior.

> Got an e-mail from @BitMEX about old #Bitcoin deposit transaction (last
> summer) that "may be connected with activity that is against 1.1(a) of the
> HDR Terms of Service.", it was @joinmarket coinjoin. #privacy

> Asked me to do KYC (will not do, I don’t care about Bitmex account anymore)

In March of 2021, PayPal banned Larry Brandt who, [according to the _Electronic
Frontier Foundation_](https://archive.ph/Xey2H#selection-1023.137-1033.92),
primarily used his account to fund [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) nodes.
The _EFF_, whose report was published on June 2, [communicated with PayPal and
tried](https://archive.ph/Xey2H#selection-1071.0-1071.437) (fruitlessly) to get
a more detailed explanation of why Brandt's account was terminated:

> We reached out to PayPal for clarification, to urge them to reinstate
> Brandt’s account, and to educate them about Tor and its value in promoting
> freedom and privacy globally. PayPal denied that the shutdown was related to
> the concerns about Tor, claiming only that “the situation has been determined
> appropriately” and refusing to offer a specific explanation. After several
> weeks, PayPal has still refused to reinstate Brandt’s account.

As is the case with other forms of internet censorship (particularly when
government is involved, implicitly or explicitly), [Brandt was banned
_suddenly_ and _without the possibility for
appeal_](https://archive.ph/Xey2H#selection-1133.40-1133.317):

> Brandt’s account was shut down without notice, he was given no opportunity to
> appeal, and he was given no clarity on what actions resulted in his account
> being shut down, nor whether this was in relation to a violation of PayPal’s
> terms – and, if so, which part of those terms.

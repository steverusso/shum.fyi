Binance Singapore froze the account of user @bittlecat for attempting a Bitcoin
withdrawal to a Wasabi mixing address. @bittlecat posted about this on Twitter
and [provided](img1.jpg) [screenshots](img2.jpg) of the
[communication](img3.jpg) they had with Binance support:

> Bitcoiners be warned: this is what happens if @BinanceSGD finds you
> withdrawing to @wasabiwallet
>
> Not surprised that my transactions are tracked, it's KYC after all
>
> But I'm very concerned that Binance knew I was sending to wasabi, when all I
> input was a bc1 address, nothing more

@bittlecat was required to submit KYC/AML data (specifically occupation, annual
income, and reason for withdrawing to a Wasabi address) in order to have [their
account unsuspended and their funds unfrozen](https://archive.ph/hF2DU).
Additionally, [Binance required](img4.jpg) that they "acknowledge within 72
hours" that they would no longer withdraw to a mixing service going forward:

> [...] Binance Singapore does not tolerate any transactions directly or
> indirectly with gambling, P2P, and especially darknet/mixer sites. As such,
> your account will be suspended until we obtain acknowledgement within 72
> hours that you will not transact with any of the above-mentioned types of
> sites going forward.

The transaction was identified as going to a Wasabi mixing process _almost
certainly_ due to Wasabi's use of a static fee address.

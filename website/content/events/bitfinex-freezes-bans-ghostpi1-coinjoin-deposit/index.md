Reddit user `u/GhostPi1` had his Bitfinex account frozen when they went to
withdraw some Bitcoin that was [deposited months prior from a coinjoin
transaction](https://archive.ph/4Kyxg#selection-1991.0-1991.130):

Bitfinex didn't reply _back for nearly a month_, at which time they informed
`u/GhostPi1` that they would be [permanently suspending the
account](notice.png) and allowing the remaining funds to be withdrawn within 5
business days:

Gal Vallerius was a darknet narcotics dealer in France who went by the alias
"OxyMonster." U.S. government agents were able to track Bitcoin transactions to
and from "OxyMonster" and noticed that Bitcoin usually went to Vallerius's
account on LocalBitcoins.com, a site for trading Bitcoin over-the-counter. [Jay
Weaver for the _Miami Herold_
reported](https://archive.ph/9q7W7#selection-3841.286-3841.545):

> In August, agents learned that “OxyMonster” was using a certain bitcoin
> address for the sales transactions. They soon analyzed incoming and outgoing
> transactions from that bitcoin address and discovered that most of them went
> to Vallerius on Localbitcoins.com

U.S. agents arrested him when he traveled to the U.S. for a beard growing
competition.

U.S. Bitcoin mining corporation Marathon mined its first "compliant block"
about a week after diverting all of its hashing power to its new "compliant
mining pool" (which was
[announced](/e/marathon-announces-compliant-mining-pool/) about a month prior).
The following [is an excerpt](https://archive.ph/I8y3O#selection-967.0-971.437)
from Marathon's press release:

> On March 30, Marathon announced that it was launching the first Bitcoin
> mining pool based in North America that is fully compliant with U.S.
> regulations, including AML and OFAC’s standards. The mining pool refrains
> from processing transactions from those listed on the U.S. Department of
> Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN),
> [...].
>
> On May 1, Marathon began directing all of its hashrate to the new mining
> pool. As a result, all bitcoin that Marathon produces from May 1 onwards will
> be produced in a manner that complies with U.S. regulatory standards.

The block's coinbase transaction contained data [which, in part,
read](https://archive.ph/evmf3) "MARA Pool - OFAC Compliant Block."

Shortly after taking off from Tehran, Iran on January 8, 2020, [Ukraine
International Airlines flight PS752](https://archive.ph/Sz2vZ) was struck down
by missiles from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, killing everyone on board.
The _Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton_ launched a GoFundMe for the families
and friends of the passengers, as did an individual named Shayesteh Majdnia (a
board member of that organization). Both fundraisers were quickly flagged and
taken down.

Luckily, both were also reinstated. However, as _CBC News_
[reported](https://archive.ph/LxkGV#selection-1745.153-1745.242) regarding the
_IHSE_ fundraiser, GoFundMe demanded "a clear explanation of how you know the
intended recipients of your campaign's donations." Even after they complied and
the fundraiser was reinstated, GoFundMe
[said](https://archive.ph/LxkGV#selection-2085.45-2085.313) that the funds
would still be subject to a "precautionary hold":

> [...] a GoFundMe "community manager" advised the IHSE that their campaign was
> "queued for a proactive review, but has since been cleared to raise funds"
> and added that <mark>funds in the account are subject to a precautionary hold
> until their payment processor completes a review.</mark>

GoFundMe [told _CBC News_ in an
email](https://archive.ph/LxkGV#selection-2237.0-2237.93) that the word "Iran"
"is not a restricted term." However, as a test, _CBC News_ created a fundraiser
for people in Canada, but included the word "Iran" in the description. It [was
shutdown within an hour](https://archive.ph/LxkGV#selection-2221.0-2221.261).

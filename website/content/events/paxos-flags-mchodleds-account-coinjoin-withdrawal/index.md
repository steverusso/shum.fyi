Shortly after successfully withdrawing to a Wasabi mixing address, Paxos
flagged the acccount of @McHodled and sent them [the following
message](notice.jpg):

> We noticed that a BTC withdrawal from your account has potentially been sent
> to a known Bitcoin mixing service. This type of transaction is not permitted
> on the platform. Please confirm whether the funds have been sent to a mixing
> service.

@McHodled [later tweeted](https://archive.ph/Wgi46#selection-3789.5-3789.94)
that it was the fixed fee address for Wasabi that gave it away:

> The fixed fee address is the issue. One I was completely fine with living
> with until now.

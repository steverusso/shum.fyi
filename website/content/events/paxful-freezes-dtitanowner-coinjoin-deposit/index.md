After Reddit user `u/Dtitanowner` had deposited Bitcoin from three Wasabi coinjoin
transactions, Paxful froze their account and [sent them the following
message](https://archive.ph/fROeU#selection-2275.52-2283.143):

> Please note that your account is undergoing compliance review. As per
> compliance review, please provide answers to the following enhanced due
> diligence questions:
> 1. What's the source of the your funds? Please explain the source of funds
> that your account is receiving, especially 3 last received transactions

`u/Dtitanowner` didn't hear back from Paxful for _over four months_ when they
[finally decided](https://archive.ph/fROeU#selection-3477.0-3497.62) to ban the
account because it was "high risk." Luckily, they did unfreeze the remaining
funds and allow for them to be withdrawn.

> Figured I'd provide an update. Today they emailed me that my account was
> banned but my BTC were available for withdrawal.
>
> "We completed our compliance review and determined to ban your account with
> Paxful as it's beyond our risk-appetite. We understand your privacy concerns,
> but the substantial amount of funds from the Wasabi wallet is high-risk for
> Paxful.
>
> [...]
>
> While your account has been banned and you are prohibited from further use of
> the Paxful platform, you are allowed to withdraw any remaining funds in your
> account. We apologize for the delay and sorry for the inconvenience."

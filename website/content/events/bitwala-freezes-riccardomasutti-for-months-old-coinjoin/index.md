Twitter user @RiccardoMasutti had their Bitwala account frozen due to a
six-month-old coinjoin deposit. Bitwala also demanded additional KYC/AML data
in order to have the account restored. @RiccardoMasutti posted a thread on
Twitter which opened with the following:

> @bitwala sent me an email 3 days ago about a couple of post-CoinJoin
> transactions that happened almost 6 MONTHS AGO.
>
> "We await your response with the requested information within the next 5 days
> in order to be able to continue our banking journey together."

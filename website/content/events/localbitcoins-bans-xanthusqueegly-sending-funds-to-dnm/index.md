In a post titled _"Local bitcoin website terminated my account after ~8yrs"_, a
user on Reddit showed a screenshot of the notice LocalBitcoins sent to them
when they terminated the account for sending funds directly to a DarkNet
Market. [The message](notice.jpg) opened with the following:

> We have noticed that you have been sending/receiving bitcoins to/from
> prohibited wallets/platforms/websites. As per our terms of service your
> LocalBitcoins account has been terminated on **2021-04-15**. You have lost
> the right to use the account Xanthusqueegly.

User `u/Izzytdi` sold Monero for Bitcoin on Bisq, and then deposited that
Bitcoin on Poloniex and Bitfinex. Poloniex quickly froze the account but did
not communicate further for at least two months. Bitfinex also froze
`u/Izzytdi`'s account [and demanded an absurd amount of KYC/AML
data](https://archive.ph/eC9Rj#selection-489.0-493.380):

> The first exchange was poloniex, which out of the blue just stopped my
> withdrawals. When I opened tickets all they will tell me is that my trading
> “looks suspicious” and needs a person to approve it. They will give no
> information and are not asking me for any information but just keep giving me
> that empty response. It has been 60 days.
>
> Second exchange is Bitfinex this week, they also stopped withdrawals and also
> all trading, and they too responded with a generic you look suspicious but
> they are now asking for KYC info, like way to much information kind of
> questions like tax forms, passports, all previous transactions, my owned
> addresses, and TXs from all wallets/exchanges and view keys from my monero
> wallets.

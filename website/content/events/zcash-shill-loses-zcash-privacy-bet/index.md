Shortly after the _Electronic Frontier Foundation_ announced that they are
accepting Zcash donations, some people voiced concerns about Zcash's weak
privacy. In response, a Zcash shill going by the handle `@MoneyKnowledge0` made
a z-address donation to the _EFF_'s z-address, a transaction that is supposed
to be "completely anonymous," and then challenged anyone to find the original
t-address:

> Above is the tx-id to my donation. Please, if you are all sure of yourselves
> trace my T-address. Reward is $100 of a currency of your choice. If no one
> responds in the next 72 hours Iâ€™m led to believe all the privacy flawed Zcash
> tweets are just false information.

Twitter user `@The8Connor` [replied less than a day
later](https://archive.ph/En2Xk) with the t-address, [confirmed by
`@MoneyKnowledge0`](https://archive.ph/En2Xk#selection-5091.0-5091.77). He
[told `@MoneyKnowledge0`](https://archive.ph/38P9T#selection-4141.0-4141.280)
that the funds were transferred only a few blocks after they were shielded, and
that next time the funds must be divided up and held for longer before
transferring. Fluffypony pointed out that if some dude on Twitter can crack the
most basic usage of Zcash, then he might have been better off using a Bitcoin
wallet like Samourai instead:

> I mean, if you've got to divide the funds up and take long breaks between
> transactions (else some dude on Twitter might figure it out) you might as
> well just use Bitcoin with Samourai wallet, which does that for you.

> Frankly, it sounds to me like you used ZCash the way it's intended to, and
> the way that even the most sophisticated user would.

title: Should Have Used Monero
---

The acronym _SHUM_ seems to have first appeared in a Reddit post made by
`u/dnale0r` about how the U.S. government was able to [track and arrest a dark
net user via his Bitcoin transactions](/e/us-gov-tracks-arrests-oxymonster/).
It quickly became a meme as a response to not only the privacy failings of
Bitcoin, but rather [any failing](https://archive.ph/RbLTt) of both crypto and
legacy fiat systems.

### Why Monero? Doesn't Bitcoin Fix Fiat?

Existing financial systems are frequently restrictive: bank accounts are
shutdown, users are banned from platforms like PayPal or GoFundMe, and
transactions are blocked by payment networks like Visa or Mastercard. People
often use Bitcoin as a solution without realizing it's somewhat of a
surveillance network due to its completely transparent ledger. Bad actors can
easily scrutinize financial activities of Bitcoin users which allows for things
like [compliant mining](/t/compliant-mining/) and [tainted
coins](/t/tainted-coins/). Therefore, it is not a viable solution.

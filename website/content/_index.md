title: Should Have Used Monero
---

The acronym _SHUM_ seems to have first appeared in a Reddit post made by
`u/dnale0r` about how the U.S. government was able to [track and ~~kidnap~~
arrest a dark net user via his Bitcoin
transactions](/e/us-gov-tracks-arrests-oxymonster/).  It quickly became a meme,
essentially meaning "you should have protected your privacy by using Monero
instead."

One day, someone launched [ShouldHaveUsedMonero.xyz](https://archive.ph/RbLTt)
to chronicle more real-world impacts of Bitcoin's lack of privacy, but sadly it
no longer exists. While there are [other resources](/other-resources/) for
financial censorship and Bitcoin's fungibility issues, this site aims to
aggregate the data and improve how it is presented.

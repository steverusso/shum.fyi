title: Should Have Used Monero
---

The acronym _SHUM_ seems to have first appeared in a Reddit post made by
`u/dnale0r` about how the U.S. government was able to [track and ~~kidnap~~
arrest a dark net user via his Bitcoin
transactions](/e/us-gov-tracks-arrests-oxymonster/).  It quickly became a meme,
essentially meaning "you should have protected your privacy by using Monero
instead."

One day, someone launched [ShouldHaveUsedMonero.xyz](https://archive.ph/RbLTt)
to chronicle more real-world impacts of Bitcoin's lack of privacy, but sadly it
no longer exists. While there are other resources for Bitcoin's fungibility
issues, such as [Seth Simmons' _Bitcoin's Fungibility
Graveyard_](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/) and
[6102bitcoin's CoinJoin flaggging
page](https://6102bitcoin.com/coinjoin-flagging/), this site aims to expand the
scope of the data and improve how it is presented.

title: Should Have Used Monero
---

The acronym _SHUM_ seems to have first appeared in a Reddit post made by
`u/dnale0r` about how the U.S. government was able to [track and ~~kidnap~~
arrest a dark net user via his Bitcoin
transactions](/e/us-gov-tracks-arrests-oxymonster/).  It quickly became a meme,
essentially meaning "you should have protected your privacy by using Monero
instead."

One day, someone launched [ShouldHaveUsedMonero.xyz](https://archive.ph/RbLTt)
to chronicle more real-world examples of the lack of privacy in existing
financial systems (including Bitcoin), but sadly it no longer exists. There are
[other resources](/other-resources/) for financial censorship and Bitcoin's
fungibility issues. However, this site aims to aggregate the data and
ultimately show the importance of striving for maximum financial privacy and
truly fungible money in this increasingly surveilled world.

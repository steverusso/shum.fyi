LocalBitcoins is a global peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange based in Finland that
has [embraced](https://archive.ph/tRiF8) AML regulations. When the Finnish
Parliament passed AML virtual currency regulation, LocalBitcoins made a blog
post [saying this would](https://archive.ph/AeC1W#selection-241.542-241.679)
"[create] a legal status for crypto assets, which should improve significantly
Bitcoinâ€™s standing as a viable and legit financial network."

A few months later, [LocalBitcoins removed the
option](https://archive.ph/1qOoL) for users to make in-person cash trades. A
few weeks after that, [they announced](https://archive.ph/JVjcx) the launch of
their new verification system which was the result of their partnership with
Onfido, "a leading identity verification technology provider." Eventually the
verification requirements were increased until even simply receving Bitcoin or
creating ads [required full KYC
verification](https://archive.ph/xiopi#selection-681.183-681.312).

In the Spring of 2020, surveillance corporation CipherTrace [published a
report](https://archive.ph/puSt8#selection-1591.29-1591.300) which in part
stated that a significant amount of tainted coins were traded traded through
LocalBitcoins:

> Finnish exchanges ranked #1 in highest percentage of criminal BTC received ,
> with 12.01% of all BTC funds received coming directly from criminal sources.
> Finland-based LocalBitcoins, one of the largest peer-to-peer marketplaces,
> received over 99% of these criminal funds.

On July 28, 2020, LocalBitcoins [announced](/i/localbitcoins-elliptic/) their
partnership with surveillance corporation Elliptic to "prevent the illicit use
of its platform and comply with regulations."

P2P cryptocurrency exchange Paxful partnered with surveillance corporation
Chainalysis to "monitor large volumes of cryptocurrency activity and identify
high risk transactions on a continuous basis." The following [is an
excerpt](https://archive.ph/LlXRk#selection-4489.221-4489.563) from the opening
paragraph of the press release from Chainalysis:

> Paxful uses Chainalysis KYT (Know Your Transaction) to monitor its platform's
> cryptocurrency transactions in real-time and Chainalysis Reactor to build
> investigations when it detects suspicious activity. Together, these tools
> amplify Paxful's compliance expertise and sets a new compliance benchmark for
> P2P cryptocurrency exchanges globally.

The press release went on to explain how Chainalysis _does_ consider P2P
exchanges "inherently risky" due to the greater levels of decentralization and
privacy they offer, but [changed that evaluation for Paxful once Paxful
integrated with Chainalysis
products](https://archive.ph/LlXRk#selection-4493.0-4493.528):

> Previously, Chainalysis considered all P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as
> inherently risky and labelled them as such in its products because most are
> decentralized and oftentimes don't even require users to set up an account.
> Paxful, however, set a new precedent for P2P exchanges by focusing on
> top-notch compliance and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards, driving
> Chainalysis to evolve its policy and evaluate P2P exchanges on a case-by-case
> basis before labeling them as risky, just as it does for other cryptocurrency
> exchanges.
